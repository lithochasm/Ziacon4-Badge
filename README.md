# Ziacon4-Badge
Ziacon 4 / 2023 Badge


Designed for Ziacon 4.

This year I chose for a non electronic badge due to time constraints. The badge is a relief of the Sandia Mountains with the text Ziacon 2023 vertically on the side. Made with a STL created from Touch Terrain from Iowa State University: https://touchterrain.geol.iastate.edu

Scaled the model in blender, and then trimmed the edges to give it that BattleStar Galactica vibe, and not poke you as much (Thanks Bob!).

Printed on a PrusaMini+ with  Reprapper Triple Color Filament PLA in Gold/Silver/Copper. (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09ZTWLNCL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
